## Introduction

In this project, Icreate an API that might be requested to interact with a ML model. This enables individuals and organizations keep their model architecture secret or to make their model available to users already having an API. By creating an API, and deploying it, a model can receive request using the internet protocol as presented by the illustration below.

## Description

<!-- 
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) # 
-->

There is  a minimal API demo with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), this will make sure that everything works correctly. Then, I will then create my own API, this will allow you to interact with a Machine Learning model, that is:
- Pass data through a request;
- Get the data in using the API;
- Apply the necessary processing;
- Submit the processed data to the ML model to make the predictions;
- Process the predictions obtained and return them as the API's response ot the input request.




## Setup

Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: repository_name> ...`  follow the steps below:

- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol ` ; ` but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.

## Run FastAPI

- Run the demo apps (being at the repository root):
        
  FastAPI:
    
    - Demo

          uvicorn src.demo_01.api:app --reload 

    <!-- - Salary prediction

          uvicorn src.salary.api:app --reload  -->


  - Go to your browser at the following address, to explore the api's documentation :
        
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
